 * Description: Defines the CreditSale collection in MongoDB.
 * Records deferred payment transactions (credit sales to trusted buyers).
 * Completely separate from regular sales to maintain clear financial tracking.
 * When a credit sale is recorded, stock is automatically reduced in Produce collection.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Separate collection from regular sales
 * - Tracks buyer identity (NIN, location, contact)
 * - Due date tracking for payment follow-up
 * - Status tracking (pending, paid, overdue)
 * - Automatic stock reduction on recording
 * - Alerts for overdue payments
 * - Database indexes for efficient reporting
